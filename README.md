### 🎯 [Computer Vision – Knowledge-aware Object Detection (Symbolic Knowledge Injection)](https://github.com/rubincrk/ethics_ai)
Reproduced and extended the paper [Object Detection Meets Knowledge Graphs](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2017/0230.pdf) using FRCNN, YOLOv8, and DETR. Integrated external knowledge via semantic consistency; found that original FRCNN results were not reproducible, and knowledge-aware optimization caused performance drops with YOLO and DETR.
